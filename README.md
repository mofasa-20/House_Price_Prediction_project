# House_Price_Prediction_project

**Introduction**
The real estate sector is an important industry with many stakeholders ranging from regulatory bodies to private companies and investors. Among these stakeholders, there is a high demand for a better understanding of the industry operational mechanism and driving factors.
Today there is a large amount of data available on relevant statistics as well as on additional contextual factors, and it is natural to try to make use of these in order to improve our understanding of the industry. Notably, this has been done in Zillow's Zestimate [4] and Kaggle's competitions on housing prices [2].

In some cases, non-traditional variables have proved to be useful predictors of real estate trends. For example, in [3] it is observed that Seattle apartments close to specialty food stores such as Whole Foods experienced a higher increase in value than average.

This project can be considered as a further step towards more evidence-based decision making for the benefit of these stakeholders. The project focused on assessment value for sales price based on data. The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for change in house prices based on certain dependent variables.

The data belong to Ames, Ames (/eÉªmz/) is a city in Story County, Iowa, United States, located approximately 30 miles (48 km) north of Des Moines in central Iowa.
